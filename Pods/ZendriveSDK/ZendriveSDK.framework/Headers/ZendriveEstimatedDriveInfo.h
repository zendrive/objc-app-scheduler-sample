/**
 * This contains the best estimated results for a drive, this is returned from
 * processEndOfDrive: callback.
 *
 * The data of this type will always be of same or little bad quality than
 * ZendriveAnalyzedDriveInfo returned from processAnalysisOfDrive:
 *
 * All drives with driveType not set to ZendriveDriveTypeInvalid will get a 
 * corresponding processAnalysisOfDrive: callback.
 *
 * Typically processAnalysisOfDrive: will be fired within
 * a few seconds after processEndOfDrive: callback but in some rare cases
 * this delay can be really large depending on phone network conditions.
